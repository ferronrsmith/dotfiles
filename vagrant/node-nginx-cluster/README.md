This project demonstrates how to setup a simple multi-vm environment in Vagrant consisting of:

* nginx as load balancer
* two node.js application servers

This requires Vagrant, Chef, and Virtualbox to be installed.  The Vagrantfile uses the precise32 box which also needs to be downloaded.

To use this after installing all the prerequisites, just run 'vagrant up'.
