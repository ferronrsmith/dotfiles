# Specifies that the command script is to be used to communicate rather than a 
# specific terminal device. Pppd will allocate itself a pseudo-tty master/slave pair 
# and use the slave as its terminal device. The script will be run in a child process 
# with the pseudo-tty master as its standard input and output. An explicit device name 
# may not be given if this option is used. (Note: if the record option is used in conjuction 
# with the pty option, the child process will have pipes on its standard input and output.)
pty "pptp vpn.work.groupbyinc.com --nolaunchpppd"

# Set the name of the local system for authentication purposes to name. 
# This is a privileged option. With this option, pppd will use lines in the secrets files 
# which have name as the second field when looking for a secret to use in authenticating the peer. 
# In addition, unless overridden with the user option, name will be used as the name to 
# send to the peer when authenticating the local system to the peer. 
# (Note that pppd does not append the domain name to name.)
name groupby

# Add a default route to the system routing tables, using the peer as the gateway, 
# when IPCP negotiation is successfully completed. This entry is removed when the PPP 
# connection is broken. This option is privileged if the nodefaultroute option has been specified.

# This name must match the one defined in the /etc/ppp/chap-secrets file

# If this option is given, the string supplied is given as the 6th parameter to those scripts.
